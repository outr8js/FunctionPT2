        text: "Everyone talks about the huge hospital bills, the copays, the deductibles that feel like a second rent. What almost nobody talks about is the slower failure happening in fluorescent-lit rooms across the country: people in real pain being rushed through physical therapy like products on a conveyor belt, told to be grateful they're getting any care at all."

        text: "That's where this story starts. Not with a fancy machine or a miracle stretching routine, but with one physical therapist in the Bronx who got tired of watching people leave just as broken as they arrived—and decided he'd rather risk everything than keep playing along."

        text: "If you've ever done physical therapy at a high-volume clinic, you already know the script. You walk in hurting, scared, or just exhausted from dealing with the same problem for months or years. You fill out forms, circle where it hurts on a stick figure chart, repeat your story three times to three different people, and then finally see the therapist—who already looks behind."
      },
      {
        type: "paragraph",
        text: "You get five minutes of hands-on time, if that. The therapist is juggling three or four patients at once. You get sent to a bike, a band, a table. You're handed a generic exercise sheet that looks suspiciously like what they give everyone. You do “3 sets of 10,” you get told to come back two or three times a week, and you go home wondering what exactly just happened."
      },
      {
        type: "paragraph",
        text: "On paper, the clinic is “helping a lot of people.” In reality, it's bleeding everyone slowly—time, money, and hope. That's the world where Vic Balaoing, DPT, started."

        type: "paragraph",
        text: "He did everything right. He went through the education, he learned the science, he sharpened his skills. He walked into the profession hungry to fix people, not just see them. What he ran into wasn't a knowledge problem. It was a time problem—weaponized by a business model."

        type: "paragraph",
        text: "He watched patient after patient plateau, not because their body couldn't improve, but because the model he was forced to work in would not allow the care they actually needed. He hit a point where he had to decide: stay in the machine, hit the productivity numbers, and learn to look away—or leave and risk failing on his own terms."

        text: "The first non-negotiable was simple and radical in today's system: time. Sessions aren't 15 rushed minutes. They're 45 to 60 minutes. They're one-on-one. The clock exists to give the patient what they need, not to push them out the door."

She had already done “the right things.” She had gone to physical therapy—more than one clinic, more than one round. She did the exercises, showed up, and waited for change."
